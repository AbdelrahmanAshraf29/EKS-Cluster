# Step 1: Install Terraform
Make sure Terraform is installed on your machine. 

# Step 2: Set Up AWS Credentials
Ensure you have your AWS credentials configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI:
aws configure

# Step 3: Create the Project Directory
Create a directory for your Terraform project:

mkdir my-eks-cluster
cd my-eks-cluster

# Step 4: Create the main.tf File
Create a main.tf file, which will define the EKS cluster and node groups using the AWS EKS Terraform module.

# What is EKS Module?
Elastic Kubernetes Service) module in Terraform is a pre-packaged set of configurations and best practices to help you create and manage EKS clusters on AWS more easily and efficiently. 
It abstracts many of the complex details involved in setting up an EKS cluster, providing a simplified interface to define and configure the cluster, its node groups, and associated resources.


# Summary
This guide covers the entire process of creating an EKS cluster using Terraform, including setting up the project, configuring the EKS cluster and node groups, and verifying the deployment. 
By following these steps, you can easily manage and deploy EKS clusters using Terraform.
